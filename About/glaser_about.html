            <h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
            <p>Stephanie Russell is a 25-year-old student at Bellevue University who is currently working on a
                bachelor’s in graphics design. She hails from a small town in Iowa called Waverly where life was slower
                than she would have liked. She spent most of her childhood hanging out with friends and family and
                playing outside. She is most like her mother in that she is quiet and reserved until you get to know
                her. She often worries about things that are out of her control but is energized to confront any
                problems in front of her. In high school, she was a part of band as a clarinet player and also was a
                soprano in the school Choir. In her free time, she enjoys developing her artistic skills and playing
                with her two cats, Icarus and Gidget. Her first job was working as a dietary aid at a nursing home.
                She assisted with residents’ dietary needs and enjoyed conversing with the residents. Her dream is to
                become a full-time artist once she graduates from college. She hopes to move to Seattle someday once
                she can settle down. She fell in love with the city’s climate and lush atmosphere. Her biggest role
                model is her close friend Emily, who lives life to the fullest every day. The once advice she would
                give her younger self is “You have more talent than you think”.</p>
